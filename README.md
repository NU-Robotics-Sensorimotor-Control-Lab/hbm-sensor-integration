# HBM Sensor Integration

This experimental protocal is based on the old version designed by Jackson

# Introduction

Compared with the old version, this new version used the HBM QuantumX MX840B device and the Multiaxis Force Sensor MCS10 to get the Fz and Mz data. I installed the HBM QuantumX API 4 in my local computer and use pythonnet to connect the HBM.QuantumX.DLL file with data_intake.py file. Then I use the funcitons from the DLL file and read the data.

# Quick start

Open the experiment_main.py file and run the Python file.
