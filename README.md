# HBM-sensor-integration

This project is used to connect QuantumX MX840B and HBM MCS10 sensor with python programming language

## 1, Environment

In order to use Python to get the data from HBM sensor, Python 3.3 need to be installed in the computer. The link what I used is https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-335rc1/

The MATLAB version I used is MATLAB R2014b

## 2, Quickstart(windows10)

Step1: open cmd in windows system and then go to the "\MATLAB\R2014b\extern\engines\python" folder. For example, in my computer:

  d:
  cd Program Files (x86)\MATLAB\R2014b\extern\engines\python
 
Step2:

  python setup.py install

Step3:Run the DAQ_read.py file
